# LOC Cause Differentiation Project

## Overview
This repository hosts notebooks for a specialized task in differentiating causes of Loss of Consciousness (LOC) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches.

## Project Description
The task focuses on distinguishing between various causes of LOC, leveraging the power of ML and DL algorithms. The notebooks contain detailed implementations, including data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Files in the Repository

1. **Deep_learning_prediction.ipynb**
   - Demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in differentiating LOC causes. It includes model architectures, training procedures, and performance metrics specific to deep learning.

2. **Machine_learning_prediction.ipynb**
   - Focuses on using traditional machine learning methods for the same task. It covers a range of algorithms, feature selection techniques, and comparative analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, torch (for the deep learning notebook)

## Usage
